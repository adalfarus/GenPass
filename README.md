# Gen4Pass5
Ignore every File that is duplicate and/or isn't in a folder deeper than src. Also remember this isnt a full repository yet, especially for everything after Gen3Pass.
The biggest problem with 3 and above is that the approach of saving the db in the executable is not possible (at least with python) so I'll have to update them to create a 
db where the user chose.
